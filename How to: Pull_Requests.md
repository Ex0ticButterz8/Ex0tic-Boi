# Ex0tic-Boi How to make a pull request:

If is a issue, such as a bug, make changes under the `bug-fixes` branch

If is a enhancement, such as a feature request, make changes under the `enhancement` branch,

If your issue gets approved, it will go through beta testing before being merged into the `implemented` branch
It will remain in the `beta-testing` branch otherwise.
